# Short Reflection
After setting up the file structure for the website, I asked Copilot to help me generate starter code and content. Then I further updated the colors, the logo routes, updated my personal info and fine-tuned some parts of the code.

# Appliance Energy Consumption Australia

This project is a multi-page website for the COS30045 Data Visualization Unit. It provides information and tips about appliance energy consumption in the Australian market, with a focus on helping users make informed, energy-efficient choices.

## Features
- Three pages: Home, Televisions, and About Us
- Top navigation menu with active page highlighting and mouseover feedback
- Power icon logo that links to the Home page
- Modern, responsive design with a color scheme matching the logo
- Footer with year, author, and GenAI acknowledgement
- Placeholder content and sample data for energy consumption

## Credits
- GenAI was used to generate content and starter code for this project.
- Further customizations, color updates, and logo adjustments were made manually.
